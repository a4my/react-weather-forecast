# Weather Forecast App ☀️🌤️🌙⛈️⚡❄️

This repository contains the files for my first project using Next.js! This is a weather forecast app built with React and Next.js. Users can search for a city and get hourly, daily and weekly information about the weather coming from an API.

The other goal with this project was to try and figure out how to use Next.js to create non-static pages.

## Responsiveness 📱
This project is responsive on any devices.
