# Weather Forecast App ☀️🌤️🌙⛈️⚡❄️

This repository contains the files of one of my React projects. This React App is supposed to be an app that lists video games and where you can search for a video game.

This project has parts that are mainly hard-coded and you cannot use the searchbar to search for a specific video game. However, the list of video games is coming from an API.

## What I used 🔨
My goal with this small application was to gather all different tools I've learned about for the past year such as HTML, SASS, Javascript and React JS.

## Extra learning ✔
I also wanted to use the data from an API and render the data on the front end with React JS.

## Responsiveness 📱
This project is responsive on any devices.
